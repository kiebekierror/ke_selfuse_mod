    <label>automatic sniper rifle</label>
    <description>Short-stroke sniper rifle.\n\nA technical marvel, this rifle started life as failed project. It was originally intended as a semi-auto rifle, however complications with the trigger pack made full-auto runways extremely common. Whilst this would have killed most projects, the groupings collected from these failed tests were still extremely tight, and it was decided that experimentation on a fully-automatic version would begin. Only 4 experimental rifles were built before the government that was backing the project fell, and the rifles were quietly forgotten.\n\nEquipped with a telescopic sight to increase effective range.\n\nFires an intermediate rifle caliber projectile.</description>
